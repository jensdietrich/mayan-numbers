1. instead of top-down, numbers are written left-to-right
2. digits (= numbers up to 20 exclusive, as Mayan numerals use a  vigesimal, base-20 system) are separated by `_`
3. zero is represented by `0`
4. a dot is represented by `*`
5. a bar is represented by `|` (since numbers are rotated clockwise 90 degrees, the horizontal bar is not vertical)
